Ford released the original model in 2000 for the 2001 model year--a model jointly developed and released with Mazda of Japan--who took a lead in the engineering of the two models and sold their version as the Mazda Tribute. Although the Escape and Tribute share the same underpinnings constructed from the Ford CD2 platform (based on Mazda GF underpinnings), the only panels common to the two vehicles are the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base inline-four engine, with Ford providing the optional V6. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the Ford Courier in the 1970s. Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the Ford Maverick, replacing the previous Nissan-sourced model. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury Mercury division released a rebadged version called the Mercury Mariner, sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a hybrid drivetrain option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only.",True,"true

in other words, the mazda tribute and the ford escape are the same vehicles but with different branding. they share the same platform and powertrain options, with the exception of a few shared panels. the ford escape was initially assembled by ford in the us, while mazda supplied cars for other markets. the mazda tribute was sold mainly in japan and other markets outside of north america. the ford escape was also sold in europe and china as the ford maverick, replacing the previous nissan-sourced model",meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,True

in the given passage, it's not possible to determine if anyone has won two oscars in one night because the passage talks about people who won multiple academy awards in a single year. it only provides information about individuals who won multiple academy awards in a single year, but it doesn't address the possibility of winning two oscars in one night. therefore, the correct response is false. the passage focuses on the achievement of winning multiple academy awards in a year, which is different from winning two oscars in",meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,False
